# Adversarial Poisson Learning
This repository shows the derivation and impact of an adversarial matrix against the Poisson Learning framework specified by Calder et al. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11184)

You can read an introduction to Poisson Learning, as well as the derivation of the perturbation matrix in [my paper](paper.pdf).

You can see the results yourself in python via [adversarial_poisson.py](adversarial_poisson.py). You'll need to grab jwcalder's [graph learning package](https://github.com/jwcalder/GraphLearning)
```bash
pip install graphlearning
```
in order to run the script.
